# Budget-Manager
Designed a java application that organizes purchases by type, calculates balances, and evaluates income and finances in light of the unemployment surge 
due to the coronaivirus surge.
The program will initially output a "Choose your action" list to select from, including adding income or purchases, showing your purchases, showing your balance, 
and having the ability to save and load your information to and from a file straight from the program. 
When selecting to add or show purchases, you will be prompted to another list to select which TYPE of purchase in order to keep things even more organized.
